# Introduction_To_MachineLearning_Projects
Project 1, 2 and 3 in  'Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining' third semester course all using the same data set.

Project 1 on data manipulation and visualisation, correlation and PCA analysis.
Project 2 generally on supervised learning; regression, regularization (model complexity), classification (Artificial Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees).
Project 3 generally on unsupervised learning; clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, anomaly detection and Association Mining.
The final reports can be read in the three PDF documents.

To the reports belong severeal scipts computing these machine learning aspects.
